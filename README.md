## Employee In/Out Tracking System

This is an application to track employee IN/OUT using API. You need to build a 
REACT JS based dashboard to show following information:

1. Ability to login into Dashboard as admin.
2. Ability to register employee with following details.
    - employee_id
    - employee_name
    - employee_position
    - employee_DOB (optional)
    
3. Ability to track IN/OUT of each employee (Usign API). Generally using biometric/ NFC
    - api to register/check in IN/OUT record into our database
4. Dashboard to view the employee list.
5. Employee detail page to view individual record.

### Time

We always try to give our candidates enough time to solve the puzzle, 2 working days would be a desirable point in time to get a glimpse on what you created.

### How is the exam graded?

We are looking for idiomatic use of JavaScript, and the ability to solve the problem with code that is clean and easy to
read. Please show us how you would use the language and conventions to structure things in a clear and maintainable way.

Even though we are not giving you the UI design, we believe that as a Frontend Developer you should have some ideas of
how it should look. You are free to use any styling tools that you want, SASS, css-in-js, or even styled-components.
